Error Correction Coding (ECC) is a set of techniques and algorithms which are devoted to solving the problem of reliable data transmission through the noisy channel. This is not a new field of research and a great variety of error correction codes was proposed in the last decades. 

Since good ECC algorithms can drastically increase performance of the data transmitting devices (even with very high level of channel noise) and also allow to achieve better power consumption properties, a great amount of effort is devoted to this field from all over the world. This talk is a simple and very brief overview of the basics of ECC tasks and terminology, with some short dive into the perspective research direction of using machine learning based optimizations for linear ECC codes (in particular low density parity checks (LDPC) codes, which are one of the most popular choises for linear codes up to year 2023).
