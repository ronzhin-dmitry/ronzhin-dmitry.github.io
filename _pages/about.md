Hello and welcome! My name is Dmitry, I am a mathematician, I specialize in discrete math and recieved my [PhD](https://istina.msu.ru/dissertations/425291875/) in 2022. I live in Moscow, teach in Moscow State University on the [Intelligent Systems chair](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/ronzhin/) of the [faculty of mathematics and mechanics](https://math.msu.ru/) and also work as a CS researcher and engineer. Scope of my scientific interests includes, but not limited to discrete math, error correction coding, algorithms complexity and machine learning.

I am participating in several courses in Moscow State University and its branches:
* With [prof. Chasovskikh A.A.](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/chasovskikh/) and [Polovnikov V.S.](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/polovnikov/) teaching "Graph Theory and VLSI applications" course and arranging a "Neural Networks" seminar;
* With [prof. Alekseev D.V.](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/alexeev/) and [prof. Aliseychik P.A.](http://intsys.msu.ru/staff/aliseychik/) teaching "Programming practice" in MSU Tashkent branch;

With the help of my friend and students and also by myself I sometimes write [blog posts](https://ronzhin.hashnode.dev/) about algorithms and data structures.
